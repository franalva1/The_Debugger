## Title of your project: The Debugger

## Team members: Jui, Ethan, Francisco (The Exterminators)

## Project description
Short description of the basic idea and end goal you are aiming for: 
A graphics game based on the famous game "Duck Hunt". The player will use a handmade gun consisting of a single trigger (button) and some kind of focused light sensor. The player will point this gun at bugs on the screen and press the trigger to vaporize them. There will be a leaderboard.

Include stretch goals and/or fallback position to indicate how you might fine-tune the project scope if needed.
Fallback might be to minimize graphical complexity (bugs are just circles on the screen with the same path of movement)
Stretch goals are different types of bugs, randomizing movement, including more interesting gameplay

## Hardware, budget
Itemize what hardware, if any, you need and your plan for acquiring it.
We still have to figure out exactly what kind of sensor to use, and we need to create a physical object to contain the sensor and the trigger. We also would ideally borrow a tv or large monitor. We would also need wires

Rough budget for the project. We will reimburse up to $20 per person.
$60

## Tasks, member responsibilities
Each team member should be responsible for a clearly identifiable part of the project.
Our current idea:
Francisco: Hardware, buying parts, constructing gun
Jui: Input processing, setting up gun as device
Ethan: Graphics
We do intend to work on each others' parts

## Schedule, midpoint milestones
What are the one-week goals you plan to meet for next week?
Finished gun, wired up to hardware.
Plan out program and decompose necessary functions
Start graphics (without input)

## Resources needed, issues
Are there books/code/tools/materials that you need access to? 
What are the possible risks to overcome? What are you concerned about? 
Top concern is determining what sensor to use, and acquiring it on time.

How can we help you succeed?
Help us find a sensor
